Hey there, welcome to my portfolio, I am a Data Science Student in IIT Madras and Gizmophile. I used to work as a customer service executive in Bangalore International Airport and after my shift I used to come back home and code to de-stress myself and that is when I realized that coding is not just a hobby for me but also my passion. I have created many projects while de-stressing myself most of them would be mentioned below.
